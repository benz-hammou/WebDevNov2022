/* Exercise 3 functions */

// 1. Create a function called "add" that takes two arguments (parameters named "first" and "second") and returns their sum.
function add (first, second){
return first + second
}
console.log(add(1, 2));
// 2. Create a function called "subtract" that takes two arguments (parameters named "first" and "second") and returns their difference.
function subtract (first, second){
    return first - second
    }
    console.log(subtract(1, 2));
// 3. Create a function called "multiply" that takes two arguments and returns their product.
function multiply (first, second){
    return first * second
    }
    console.log(multiply(1, 2));
// 4. Create a function called "divide" that takes two arguments and returns their quotient.


// 5. Create a function called "calculate" that takes three arguments. Assume the two arguments are a number ie num1, num2 and a function called operates (a callback).


// 6. Call the calculate function 4 times, each time using one of the operation functions you wrote


// 7. Create a function called "printDay" that takes one argument (a number from 1-7) and returns the day of the week (1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday etc.)
